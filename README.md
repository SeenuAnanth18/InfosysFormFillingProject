# Infosys Voice Form Filling Project

This project focuses on converting speech to text and enhancing user interaction through additional features.

## Features
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Implemented using the Web Speech API to transcribe user input in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech Functionality(This is my own idea)**: Added as an extra feature using the Speech Synthesis API, enabling the application to provide verbal feedback to users.

This project was developed as part of a company assignment and showcases basic voice input handling and feedback capabilities.
